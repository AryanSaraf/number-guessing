For the 3rd week of my internship with MotionCut, I was given two tasks.

## Simple Calculator

- This program is a simple calculator program that takes an operation as input, such as "4.2 x 6.6" or "2 ^ 1.3" and returns the result.
- The available operations are: (+) addition, (-) subtraction, (x,*) multiplication, (/) division, (%) modulus, (^,**) exponentiation.

## Number Guessing Game

- In this program the user has to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
- If the guess is higher than the number, it says "Too high!"; otherwise it says "Too low!".
- Additionally, the level of accuracy is indicated: "Accuracy: Low/Medium/High".
  - This tells the user how far from the target their number is.
  - The accuracy directly corresponds to the vicinity to the number.
- A fourth level of accuracy exists and is called "Super High", occurring only when the guess is extremely close to the number.
  - However the guess might be higher or lower, that is not indicated.

Both the above programs include more detailed guides inside. On running either program, type '?' to view the guide and 'q' to quit.
